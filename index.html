        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Isabel Rivera Pon. I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Pre-business and I am interested in pursuing a career in real estate. I am from Berkeley California and I hope to find opportunities within the Bay Area. Iâ€™ve had experience in customer service as a desk clerk but I would like to develop more skills to further my education and invest in myself. At the beginning of college, I was majoring in microbiology. During my first quarter, I considered my future and how my career would fit into it. I decided that being in the sciences is too big of a commitment and doesnâ€™t align with my future goals. I soon changed to pre-business and was efficient in getting myself involved in activities to develop business related skills. It is essential that I start everything as young as possible, so I am trying to get as many internships and experiences while Iâ€™m in college. As a freshman, I want to start strong and get my foot in the door by talking to different people in business and making connections. Building relationships is important to my career.
